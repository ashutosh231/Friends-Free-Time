## 📊 Terminal Output When It Works

### Token Server (Terminal 1):
When users login, you'll see:
```
✅ Generated token for user: ashutosh
✅ Generated token for user: dhruv
```

### React App (Terminal 2):
Should show hot-reload updates, no errors

---

## 🚀 After Testing

Once messaging works:

### 1. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Note: You'll need to deploy the token server separately

### 3. Build Android App (Optional)
Follow: `build-android.md`

---

## 📱 Android App Note

The token server URL in `App.jsx` is currently:
```
http://localhost:3001/generate-token
```

For the Android app to work, you'll need to:
1. Deploy token server to a public URL (Vercel/Railway/Heroku)
2. Update the URL in `App.jsx`
3. Rebuild the app

We can do this later when you're ready!

## 💡 Quick Commands

### Check Token Server Status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"ok","message":"Token server is running!"}
```

### Generate Token Manually (Testing):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/generate-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"ashutosh"}'
```
