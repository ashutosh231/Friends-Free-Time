# 🔧 Netlify Build Error - FIXED!

## Error Encountered ❌
```
Cannot find package '@tailwindcss/vite'
Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2
```

## Root Cause 🔍
Your `vite.config.js` was importing `@tailwindcss/vite`, but it wasn't installed in `package.json`.

```javascript
// vite.config.js was using:
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'  // ❌ Not installed!
```

## Solution Applied ✅

Installed the missing Tailwind CSS dependencies:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

These packages were added to `devDependencies`:
- `tailwindcss` - The main Tailwind CSS framework
- `@tailwindcss/vite` - Vite plugin for Tailwind CSS

## Files Updated 📦
- `package.json` - Added Tailwind dependencies
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new packages

## Changes Pushed ✅
```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add Tailwind CSS dependencies for Netlify build"
git push
```

## What Netlify Will Do Now 🚀

When Netlify rebuilds:
1. ✅ Install all dependencies (including Tailwind now)
2. ✅ Run `npm run build` successfully
3. ✅ Build your React app with Vite
4. ✅ Deploy to production!

## Next Steps 📋

### Option 1: Automatic Deploy (if enabled)
Netlify will **automatically rebuild** your site now that you pushed the fix!

Check: https://app.netlify.com/sites/friendsx/deploys

### Option 2: Manual Trigger
If auto-deploy isn't enabled:
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/friendsx/deploys
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Deploy site"**

## Expected Result ✨

Your build should now succeed! You'll see:
```
✅ Installing dependencies
✅ Building site (npm run build)
✅ Deploying to production
✅ Site is live!
```

## Verification Steps 🧪

Once deployed:
1. ✅ Open your Netlify URL
2. ✅ Login should work
3. ✅ Timetable should display with Tailwind styles
4. ✅ Chat should work
5. ✅ Everything looks styled correctly

## Why This Happened 🤔

Tailwind CSS v4 uses `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin in your `vite.config.js`:
```javascript
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
```

And `index.css` imports Tailwind:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

But the package wasn't in `package.json`, so Netlify couldn't install it during build.

**Local development worked** because you probably had it in `node_modules` from a previous install, but Netlify starts fresh every build.

## Prevention 💡

This is now fixed! Future deploys will work because:
- ✅ All dependencies are properly listed in `package.json`
- ✅ Netlify will install them every time
- ✅ Build will succeed

## Build Command Details 📝

Your build process:
```bash
npm install           # Installs all dependencies (including Tailwind now)
npm run build         # Runs: vite build
  → Vite loads vite.config.js
  → Imports @tailwindcss/vite ✅ (now installed!)
  → Processes Tailwind styles
  → Builds optimized production bundle
```

## Status: FIXED ✅

The error is resolved! Your next Netlify deploy will succeed.
