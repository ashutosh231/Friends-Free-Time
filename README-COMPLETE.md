## 💬 Part 2: Fix Messaging with GetStream

### Why Your Messages Don't Work:

**Problem:** LocalStorage can't sync between browsers/devices
- You send message in Chrome → Saved in Chrome's localStorage
- Friend opens in Firefox → Can't see Chrome's localStorage
- Messages never sync! ❌

**Solution:** GetStream provides a cloud backend
- All browsers connect to GetStream
- Messages saved in the cloud
- Instant sync across all devices ✅

### Setup GetStream (15 minutes):

#### Step 1: Get API Key (FREE)
```
1. Visit: https://getstream.io/chat/
2. Sign up (FREE - no credit card)
3. Create an app
4. Copy API Key from dashboard
```

#### Step 2: Configure
```bash
cd "/Users/ashutoshkumar/Desktop/friends TT/friends"

# Edit src/chatConfig.js
# Replace 'YOUR_STREAM_API_KEY' with your actual key
```

#### Step 3: Generate User Tokens
In GetStream Dashboard:
1. Go to Chat Explorer → Users
2. Create users: `ashutosh` and `dhruv`
3. Generate token for each
4. Add tokens to `src/chatConfig.js`

#### Step 4: Switch to GetStream Version
```bash
# Option A: Use script (automatic)
./setup-getstream.sh

# Option B: Manual
cp src/App-GetStream.jsx src/App.jsx
```

#### Step 5: Test
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open in two browsers:
- Chrome: Login as ashutosh
- Firefox: Login as dhruv
- Send messages → Should sync instantly! ⚡

#### Step 6: Deploy
```bash
npm run build
# Upload to Netlify
```
